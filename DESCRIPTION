Description: Provides a suite of functions for efficient file reading and pattern matching using 
    the power of 'grep' at the command line. Enables counting matches, extracting matching lines,
    finding files with matches, and viewing context lines around matches. Supports reading and 
    aggregating data from multiple files, searching with regular expressions or fixed patterns,
    and handling large files efficiently.
